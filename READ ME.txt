I HAVE USING LINKED LISTS TO IMPLEMENT 4 STRUCT WHICH ARE:
- BookNode
- BorrowBookNode
- StaffNode
- StudentNode

I HAVE FILE SYSTEM ON 4 STRUCT WHICH SAME AS ABOVE.
- BookRecord.txt
- BorrowerRecord.txt
- StaffRecord.txt
- StudentRecord.txt

THE BookNo.txt IS USE TO RECORD THE NUMBER OF BOOK HAVE BEEN CREATED.

THE CONSTRUCTOR OF EVERY CLASSES IS USE FOR INITIALIZE VALUES & RETRIEVED DATA FROM FILE INTO LINKED NODE.

THE DESTRUCTOR OF EVERY CLASSES IS USE FOR DELETE ALL THE NODES,
SO THE MEMORY IN HEAP CAN BE FREE UP.

AFTER EVERY OPTION OF USER SELECT, THERE A FUNCTION NAME "XxxFile();" IT WILL WRITE DATA INTO FILE.

THERE ARE INHERITENCE IN THIS PROGRAM WHICH ARE:
1. book CLASS IS THE SUPERCLASS OF admin, staff & student CLASSES
2. admin, staff, student CLASS ARE SUPERCLASS OF interface CLASS

OPEN & READ THE COMMENT OF ".cpp" & ".h" file BY THS ORDER:
1. main.cpp
2. interface.h
3. admin.h
4. staff.h
5. student.h
